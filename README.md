# Supplementary data: "Thermodynamically-guided machine learning for thermophysical property modeling and prediction"
#### Â Gustavo Chaparro, Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London, March 2025 

This repository is part of the supplementary data of my PhD Thesis titled: "Thermodynamically-guided machine learning for thermophysical property modeling and prediction". This repository includes scripts, databases, and artificial neural network models needed to reproduce my PhD thesis results.

1. [LAMMPS scripts folder](./1_lammps_scripts/). This folder contains scripts used to compute the thermophysical properties of the Mie particle.
1. [Mie particle databases](./2_databases/). This folder contains all the databases used to train the ANN models in this thesis.
1. [ANN models](./3_ann_models/). Trained ANN models (FE-ANN EoS, FE-ANN(s) EoS, and transport properties models).
